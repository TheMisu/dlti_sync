 New Feature Ideas

   1. Centralized Speaker Database: As suggested in the feedback, you could
      implement a speakers.json metadata file. This file would act as a
      database, assigning a unique ID to each speaker and storing their voice
      embedding. When processing new audio, the system would compare detected
      speakers against this database to identify known individuals across
      different files.
   2. Web Interface for Correction: Create a simple web-based UI (using a
      framework like Flask or FastAPI) where users can review the generated
      transcription. This would allow them to play back audio segments, correct
      transcription errors, and re-assign speaker labels if the diarization was
      inaccurate.
   3. API for Processing: Expose the transcription and diarization logic via a
      REST API. This would allow you to easily integrate the service with other
      applications or build different frontends for it in the future. You could
      have endpoints to upload a file, check processing status, and retrieve the
       results as JSON.
   4. Advanced Preprocessing Options: Expand the preprocess module to include
      more advanced options that a user could select, such as background noise
      removal tailored for specific environments (e.g., office, street) or
      advanced equalization.
   5. Keyword and Topic Analysis: After transcription, you could add a feature
      to analyze the text for keyword frequency, topic modeling, or sentiment
      analysis, providing more value than just the raw text.

  General Application Improvements

   1. Configuration Management: Enhance config.py to allow for easier
      experimentation with different models and parameters. You could move
      settings (like model names, VAD thresholds, silence duration) into a
      separate YAML or TOML file, which would allow you to switch
      configurations without changing the code. This directly addresses the
      feedback about testing model limits.
   2. Robust Dockerization: Improve the Dockerfile by using multi-stage builds
      to create a smaller, more secure production image. Ensure all system
      dependencies (like ffmpeg) are explicitly installed, and consider using a
      production-grade web server (like Gunicorn) if you build an API.
   3. Comprehensive Testing: The feedback mentions preparing tests. You could
      formalize this by implementing a testing suite with pytest. Add unit tests
       for your preprocessing functions (denoising, normalizing, etc.) and
      integration tests that run a sample audio file through the entire pipeline
       to ensure the output is consistent.
   4. Code Quality and Documentation: Run a modern linter and formatter like
      Ruff or Black over the entire codebase to ensure consistency. Improve
      code documentation by adding detailed docstrings to your functions,
      explaining not just what they do, but also the expected inputs and
      outputs, which aligns with the professor's feedback on documentation.
   5. Dependency Management: Solidify your requirements.txt by pinning package
      versions (e.g., library==1.2.3) to ensure the application is
      reproducible. For more complex projects, you might consider a dependency
      management tool like Poetry.
